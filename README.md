<p id="description">This plugin use CatForm to requires the information needed to calculate the Italian Tax Code for natural persons. The tax code is a code used for tax and administrative purposes to uniquely identify Italian citizens. This plugin is valid only for those born in a municipality in Italy. Type "calcola il codice fiscale" to run the plugin... It is possible for two people to have the same tax code, but in this case the Revenue Agency will replace some characters to resolve the ambiguity. This calculation of the tax code does not consider the rare cases of homocody (more frequent for foreign citizens) and related corrections known only to the Revenue Agency. PS: No one is authorized to calculate or provide tools for calculating the tax code: the only valid tax code is the one issued to the subject by the Revenue Agency. The algorithm implemented below to calculate the tax code does not guarantee the absolute correctness of the result.</p>
